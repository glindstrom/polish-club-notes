## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial changelog implementation

### Changed

- Documentation structure improvements
- Updated `one-diamond.md`: Corrected 3♣ response to 1♦ - 1NT to show 15-17 HCP, 5+♦, 5+♣, forcing to 3♦ (previously described incorrectly as 15-17 HCP, 6+♣, invitational). Partner should not pass; with a weak hand, partner bids 3♦.

### Fixed

- Minor formatting corrections
