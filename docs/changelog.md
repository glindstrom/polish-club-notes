## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial changelog implementation

### Changed

- Documentation structure improvements
- Updated `one-diamond.md`: Corrected 3♣ response to 1♦ - 1NT to show 15-17 HCP, 5+♦, 5+♣, forcing to 3♦ (previously described incorrectly as 15-17 HCP, 6+♣, invitational). Partner should not pass; with a weak hand, partner bids 3♦.
- Updated `one-heart.md`: Modified responder rebids after 1♥ - 1NT - 2♣/♦ to reflect 2♠ showing 10-11 HCP with 5+♣/♦ and 3♣/♦ showing 8-11 HCP with 4+♣/♦ (previously only described for 2♣).

### Fixed

- Minor formatting corrections
