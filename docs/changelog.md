All notable changes to the Polish Club Notes will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-07

### Added

- Initial changelog implementation
- Added `weak-jump-overcalls.md`: Documented weak jump overcalls, including their definition (6-card suit at 2-level, 7-card suit at 3-level, 5-10 HCP), responses, and the Ogust convention for 2NT responses.

### Changed

- Documentation structure improvements
- Updated `one-diamond.md`: Corrected 3♣ response to 1♦ - 1NT to show 15-17 HCP, 5+♦, 5+♣, forcing to 3♦ (previously described incorrectly as 15-17 HCP, 6+♣, invitational). Partner should not pass; with a weak hand, partner bids 3♦.

- Updated `overview.md`: Added reference to Weak Jump Overcalls section.
