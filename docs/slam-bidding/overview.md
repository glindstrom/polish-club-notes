# Slam Bidding Overview

### Description

Slam bidding in the Polish Club system employs a range of tools to explore small and grand slam contracts. Cue bids show first- or second-round controls, Keycard Blackwood 1430 evaluates key cards, king asks assess additional controls, bidding 5 in an agreed major signals specific slam tries, the Grand Slam Force evaluates trump quality, and a 5NT bid can propose a small slam when no trump suit is agreed. These conventions support both uncontested and competitive auctions, with responses for interference like doubles or overcalls.
