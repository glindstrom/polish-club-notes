# Cue Bidding

??? note "General Principles"
    ### General Principles

    Cue bids are used to explore slam contracts by showing first- or second-round control (ace, king, void, or singleton) in a suit. They are typically made after a trump suit is agreed, aiming to identify sufficient controls for a slam.

    Below game level, after partner makes a cue bid, a cue bid must not be bypassed:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1NT | Pass | 2♣  | Pass |
    | 2♠  | Pass | 4♣* | Pass |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    \* *4♣*: Cue bid, spades agreed.

    | Bid | Meaning                           |
    | --- | --------------------------------- |
    | 4♦  | Diamond control                   |
    | 4♥  | Heart control, no diamond control |
    | 4♠  | No heart or diamond control       |

    - **Note**: A cue bid shows the cheapest control first, bypassing a suit only if no control exists in that suit.

??? note "Cue Bids Above Game Level and After Splinters"
    ### Cue Bids Above Game Level and After Splinters

    There is no obligation to make a cue bid in response to partner’s cue bid if it would take the auction above game level:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1NT | Pass | 2♦  | Pass |
    | 3♥  | Pass | 4♦* | Pass |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    \* *4♦*: Cue bid, hearts agreed.

    | Bid | Meaning                                               |
    | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | 4♠  | Spade control, slam interest                          |
    | 4♥  | No slam interest, does not deny club or spade control |

    There is also no obligation to make a cue bid below game level after partner’s splinter bid:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♠  | Pass | 4♦* | Pass |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    \* *4♦*: Splinter, spades agreed.

    | Bid | Meaning                                       |
    | --- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | 4♥  | Heart control, slam interest                  |
    | 4♠  | No slam interest, does not deny heart control |
    | 5♣  | Club control, slam interest                   |

    - **Note**: After a splinter, a return to the agreed suit (e.g., 4♠) shows no slam interest, while bidding a new suit indicates a control and slam interest.

??? note "Four in a Major: Natural or Cue Bid"
    ### Four in a Major: Natural or Cue Bid

    A bid of 4 in a major can be ambiguous, potentially natural (to play) or a cue bid, depending on the auction. When a bid like 3♣ is a third suit to find the best game contract, a 4-in-a-major bid is natural, as no minor suit is unambiguously agreed:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 2♦  | Pass |
    | 2♥  | Pass | 3♣* | Pass |
    | 4♣  | Pass | ?   |      |

    * *3♣*: Third suit, seeking the best game.

    | Bid | Meaning                       |
    | --- | ----------------------------- |
    | 4♥  | Proposal of contract, to play |

    If a minor suit is unambiguously agreed, a 4-in-a-major bid is a cue bid showing control in that suit:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 2♦  | Pass |
    | 3♣  | Pass | 4♣* | Pass |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    * *4♣*: Strong agreement of clubs.

    | Bid | Meaning                           |
    | --- | --------------------------------- |
    | 4♦  | Diamond control                   |
    | 4♥  | Heart control, no diamond control |

    - **Note**: The context of the auction determines the meaning. A third suit bid (e.g., 3♣) suggests a natural 4-in-a-major bid, while a minor suit agreement (e.g., 3♣ – 4♣) indicates a cue bid.

??? note "Bidding After a Doubled Cue Bid"
    ### Bidding After a Doubled Cue Bid

    When an opponent doubles a cue bid, it signals a potential lead and suggests they may take the first two tricks in that suit. A pass is used to check if the partnership risks losing two tricks in the doubled suit, while other bids clarify control or slam interest:

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 3♠  | Pass | 4♣* | Dbl  |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    * *4♣*: Cue bid, spades agreed.

    | Bid      | Meaning                                    |
    | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    | Pass     | Concern about losing two club tricks       |
    | Redouble | First-round control (ace or void) in clubs |
    | 4♦/4♥    | Cue bid, not concerned about club tricks   |
    | 4♠       | No slam interest, concerned about clubs    |

    - **Note**: Pass prompts partner to clarify their club control (e.g., redouble for first-round control, 4♠ to sign off). Other bids show sufficient club control to continue slam exploration.
