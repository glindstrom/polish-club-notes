# Bidding Five in the Agreed Major

??? note "Uncontested Auction"
    ### Uncontested Auction

    Bidding an agreed major at the five level, when it could have been bid at the four level, is a slam try in an uncontested auction. The meaning depends on whether the bid is made by the partner "without trumps" (responder) or "with trumps" (opener):

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 2♠  | Pass |
    | 3♥  | Pass | ?   |      |

    | Bid | Meaning                                              |
    | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
    | 5♥  | Trump suit invitation to slam, e.g., singleton heart |

    - **Note**: By the partner "without trumps" (responder), 5♥ invites a small slam based on trump quality, indicating controls elsewhere but limited trump support (e.g., a singleton).

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 4♦* | Pass |
    | ?   |      |     |      |

    * *4♦*: Splinter, hearts agreed.

    | Bid | Meaning                                          |
    | --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | 5♥  | Slam try, good trump suit, no side suit controls |

    - **Note**: By the partner "with trumps" (opener), 5♥ shows a strong trump suit but no side controls, seeking a slam based on trump strength.

??? note "Competitive Auction"
    ### Competitive Auction

    In a competitive auction, bidding the agreed major at the five level is a slam try, with the meaning depending on whether control of the opponent’s suit has been shown:

    | They | We  | They | We  |
    | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
    | 3♥   | 3♠  | Pass | ?   |

    | Bid | Meaning                        |
    | --- | ------------------------------ |
    | 4♠  | Slam try with heart control    |
    | 5♠  | Slam try without heart control |

    - **Note**: Without a prior cue bid in the opponent’s suit (e.g., hearts), 5♠ shows a slam try lacking control in that suit, while 4♠ includes heart control.

    | They | We  | They | We  |
    | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
    | 3♥   | 3♠  | Pass | 4♥* |
    | Pass | ?   |      |     |

    * *4♥*: Slam try with heart control.

    | Bid | Meaning          |
    | --- | ---------------- |
    | 5♠  | General slam try |

    - **Note**: After showing control of the opponent’s suit (e.g., 4♥ cue bid), 5♠ becomes a general slam try, not denying additional controls.
