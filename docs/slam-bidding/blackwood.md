# Keycard Blackwood 1430

Keycard Blackwood 1430 is used to ask for key cards (four aces and the king of the agreed trump suit) when a trump suit is established or slam exploration is indicated. This section outlines when 4NT or 5NT is Blackwood, response structures, and handling of special cases like voids, interference, and trump queen asks.

## When 4NT is Keycard Blackwood

4NT is Keycard Blackwood 1430 unless it is a **quantitative invitation** under specific conditions:
- After a direct no-trump raise (e.g., 1NT–2NT or 1♣–2NT).
- Directly after 1NT opening followed by Stayman or a transfer.
- When no suit is agreed by the three level and opener’s strength is unlimited.
- After a 2NT rebid showing 18+ HCP with no upper limit.

### Quantitative 4NT Examples
| Sequence                         | Meaning                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1♣–Pass–2NT–Pass                 | Quantitative, 18–20 HCP, inviting 6NT         |
| 1NT–Pass–2♣\*–2♦/2♥/2♠           | Quantitative, inviting slam with 4-card major |
| 1NT–Pass–2♦\*\*–2♥               | Quantitative, inviting slam with 5 hearts     |
| 1♥–Pass–2♣–2♦–2NT–3♣/3♥/3♠       | Quantitative, general slam invitation         |
| 1♣–Pass–1♥/1♠–2NT\*\*\*–3♣/3♦/3♥ | Quantitative, 22–24 HCP                       |

\*2♣: Stayman.  
\*\*2♦: Transfer to hearts.

In all other sequences where a trump suit is agreed or slam exploration is indicated, 4NT is Keycard Blackwood 1430.

## Responses to 4NT Keycard Blackwood

Responses show the number of key cards (aces + trump king):

| Bid | Key Cards                     |
| --- | ----------------------------- |
| 5♣  | 1 or 4 key cards              |
| 5♦  | 0 or 3 key cards              |
| 5♥  | 2 key cards, no trump queen   |
| 5♠  | 2 key cards, with trump queen |

### Responses with a Void
When holding a void, responses to 4NT Keycard Blackwood adjust as follows:
- **2 key cards + void** (not in partner’s first-bid suit): Jump to **5NT**.
- **1 or 3 key cards + void**:
  - Jump to **6 of the void suit** if lower-ranking than the trump suit.
  - Jump to **6 of the trump suit** if the void suit is higher-ranking.
- After a void-showing response, the next step (excluding trump suit or 5NT) asks for the trump queen. New suits, if there’s room, ask for third-round control.

#### Example
- **Auction**: 1♠–Pass–3♠–Pass–4NT\* (spades agreed).
- **Hand**: ♠QJxx ♥Kxxx ♦– ♣QJxxx (1 key card, diamond void).
