# Carding Agreements

### Description

Carding agreements in the Polish Club system cover signalling and leads, using Odd/Even discards, count, suit preference, and 2nd/4th leads.

### Signalling

#### First Discard
- Odd/Even discard.  
- Exceptions:  
    - Trump contract, discard in dummy’s solid suit: Count.  
    - Notrump, discard in dummy’s solid suit: Suit preference.  

#### Later Discards
- Show count or discard cards nearest the thumb.  
- High odd then low odd in same suit: Cancels encouraging message.  
- Discarding twice from same suit:  
    - First discard: Attitude.  
    - Second discard: Original count.  
- Discarding from suit partner led: Show original count

#### Specific Situations
- Declarer peeling winners (no dummy entry, all tricks but one, worthless hand):  
    - Give partner count by voiding shortest suit immediately.  
    - Avoid random discards.  
- Notrump, dummy’s side suit solid/semi-solid with side entry:  
    - First play: Count.  
    - Second play: Suit preference.  

#### On Partner’s Lead
- Attitude has highest priority, with exceptions:  
    - A led vs suit, dummy has singleton, continuation makes no sense: Suit preference.  
    - Dummy’s holding shows 3rd hand lacks hoped-for strength: Count.  
    - Partner’s lead clearly a singleton, trick won by declaring side: Suit preference for possible entry.  
    - Layout of suit known: Suit preference.  
    - Partner led after you showed 5+ suit, partner keeps lead for trick 2:  
        - Lowest card: Suit preference for lowest suit.  
        - High card: Suit preference for highest suit.  
        - Middling cards: Continue suit.  
    - Partner leads suit you bid/supported, sets up tricks for declarer: Suit preference.  
    - Declarer has two suits (5-4+), lead in unbid suit: Count signals.  
  
#### Returning Partner’s Suit (Original Length)

When partner leads and third hand wins the trick, the return shows **original length** in the suit:

- With an **even number of cards originally**, return the **lowest spot**.
- With an **odd number of cards originally**, return a **high spot**.

**Example**  
West: ♠ Q J 10  
East holds:

- ♠ A 9 6 → return **9** (odd length: 3)  
- ♠ A 9 6 2 → return **2** (even length: 4)  
- ♠ A 9 6 4 2 → return **9** (odd length: 5)

#### On Declarer’s Lead
- Show count.  
- Exception:  
    - Notrump, dummy’s solid long suit: Suit preference.  

### Leads
- **Standard**: 2nd/4th leads.  
- **Doubleton (x-x)**: Lead low.  
- **Hx or 10x doubleton (e.g., Kx, Qx, Jx, 10x)**: Lead H or 10.  
- **Three worthless cards (x-x-x)**: Lead middle, then down-up.  
- **Four small (x-x-x-x)**: Lead second-highest, follow with top card to show even number (if affordable).  
- **Honor third (e.g., K9x)**: Can lead low if second card might cost a trick.  
- **AK doubleton or AKx+ (5-level and higher)**: Lead K.  
- **Subsequent leads**: 2nd/4th, or attitude if clearer.
