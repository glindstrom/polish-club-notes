# Defence Against Major Raise

## Overview

Defensive bids after opponents open 1♥ or 1♠ and raise to 2♥ or 2♠. A double shows a three-suiter or two-suiter (cannot have a diamond shortage, but can have a club shortage with at least a doubleton diamond). 2NT shows both minors (not necessarily equal length). 3♦ shows five diamonds. In a competitive auction without suit agreement, a double or bid of the opponent’s suit shows the possibility of playing in two suits.
