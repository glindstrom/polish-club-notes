    #### Notes
    - New suits at the 2-level (e.g., 2♦/2♥ after 1♠) or as a jump (e.g., 3♣/3♦) typically require 5+ cards, but 4-card suits are occasionally acceptable in standard systems with a strong suit and 10+ points.
    - Overcaller may raise a 2-level new suit with three-card support.

    #### Overcaller’s Continuations
    - Identical to continuations after a 1♥ or 1♠ opening (e.g., new suit = natural, raise = support).
