    ### Notes
    - **Scheme of Responses**:
        - A new suit at the one level is not forcing; it is possible to raise it with three-card support.
        - A new suit at the two level without a jump is not forcing and shows 10+ points.
        - A new suit with a jump is forcing.
        - 2♣ is the Drury convention, whose meaning depends on whether opponent’s opening was natural or artificial (1♣).
        - NT bids promise a stopper in the opponent’s suit and deny a fit – 1NT: 8–12, 2NT: 13–15.
        - Bidding opponent’s suit at the 2-level (e.g., 2♦ or 2♥) shows 12+ points, no fit, and is forcing.
        - Bidding opponent’s suit at the 3-level (e.g., 3♦ or 3♥) is natural and forcing.
        - 3♣ after opponent’s 1♣ opening is natural and forcing.
