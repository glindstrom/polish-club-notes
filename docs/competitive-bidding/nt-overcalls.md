# No Trump Overcalls

## 1NT Overcall

### Description
A **1NT overcall** in second position shows 15-17 points with a stopper in the opponent’s suit.  
A **1NT overcall** in the protective position shows 11-15 points but does not promise a stopper in the opponent’s suit.

### Development of the Auction
The same methods apply after a 1NT overcall, whether in second position or protective position (with appropriate adjustments for the different point ranges). We bid in the same way as after our 1NT opening, with the following exception:

- A transfer to the opponent’s major suit (e.g., after a 1♥ opening, bidding 2♦) shows a three-suited hand short in the opponent’s suit and is forcing to game.

#### Example Sequence

| They | We  | They | We  |
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
| 1♥   | 1NT | Pass | ?   |

- **Responder’s Bid**: 2♣ - Stayman.
- **Responder’s Bid**: 2♦ - Transfer to opponent’s suit; three-suiter, short in hearts, game forcing.
- **Responder’s Bid**: 2♥ - Transfer to spades.

    ### Responses after (1♠) - 1NT - (X, Penalty)

    | Response | Description                     |
    | -------- | ------------------------------- |
    | XX       | SOS, two playable suits, escape |
    | 2♣       | Natural, non-forcing            |
    | 2♦       | Natural, non-forcing            |

??? note "Rebids after 1NT Overcall - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)"
    ### Rebids after (1♠) - 1NT - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)

    | They | We  | They | We  |
    | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
    | 1♠   | 1NT | X    | XX  |
    | Pass | 2♣  | X    | ?   |

    | Responder’s Bid | Description             |
    | --------------- | ----------------------- |
    | Pass            | Confirms ♣ as one suit  |
    | 2♦              | Shows ♦ and ♥           |
    | XX              | Shows ♦ and ♥, longer ♥ |

    #### Note
    - A penalty double after a 1NT overcall (e.g., 1♠ - 1NT - X) prompts natural, non-forcing bids. Redouble (XX) is SOS, asking partner to bid a suit. After 2♣ (partner’s suit choice), responder clarifies suits: Pass confirms ♣ (e.g., ♣+♦ or ♣+♥), 2♦ shows ♦+♥ (as ♠ is the opponent’s suit), XX refines to ♦+♥ with longer ♥.

#### Notes
- In a competitive auction, similar rules apply as when an opponent intervenes after our 1NT opening.

## 2NT Overcall

### Description
A **2NT overcall** after an opponent’s two-level opening shows 15-18 points and a stopper in the opponent’s suit.

### Development of the Auction
Analogous methods apply as after a 1NT overcall (see above).

## 3NT Overcall

### Description
A **3NT overcall** is used in competitive bidding to show specific hand types, depending on whether it is a jump or non-jump overcall.

- **Jump 3NT Overcall**: Shows a hand with a good (usually solid) minor suit and a stopper in the opponent’s suit.
- **Non-Jump 3NT Overcall**: Can be based on either:
  - A minor suit, or
  - General strength of the hand (16-22 HCP).

This applies in any position, including the reopening position, and after a **1♣ opening** followed by a **3NT rebid** by opener without partner’s support.

### Development of the Auction
The responses to a 3NT overcall (or 3NT rebid after a 1♣ opening with interference) use **"transfers round the clock"** to explore the best contract. The same rules apply in all cases.

#### Responses to 3NT Overcall
| Responder’s Bid | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 4♣              | Transfer to diamonds                              |
| 4♦              | Transfer to hearts; three-suiter, short in hearts |
| 4♥              | Transfer to spades                                |
| 4♠              | Transfer to clubs                                 |

#### Example Sequences
1. **Direct 3NT Overcall**:

   | They | We  | They | We  |
   | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
   | 3♥   | 3NT | Pass | ?   |

   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♣ - Transfer to diamonds.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♦ - Transfer to hearts; three-suiter, short in hearts.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♥ - Transfer to spades.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♠ - Transfer to clubs.

2. **After 4♣ (Transfer to Diamonds)**:

   | They | We          | They | We  |
   | ---- | ----------- | ---- | --- |
   | 3♥   | 3NT         | Pass | 4♣  |
   | Pass | 4♦ (forced) | Pass | ?   |

   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♥ - Heart shortage, slam interest.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♠ - Natural; diamonds and spades.

3. **3NT Rebid After 1♣ Opening with Interference**:

   | They | We  | They | We   |
   | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
   |      | 1♣  | 3♥   | Pass |
   | Pass | 3NT | Pass | ?    |

   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♣ - Transfer to diamonds.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♦ - Transfer to hearts; three-suiter, short in hearts.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♥ - Transfer to spades.
   - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♠ - Transfer to clubs.

### Notes
- The "transfers round the clock" system allows responder to explore fits in all suits efficiently.
- The 4♦ response (transfer to hearts) specifically indicates a three-suiter with shortness in the opponent’s suit (e.g., hearts in a 3♥ overcall scenario).
- After a 4♣ transfer to diamonds, responder’s further bids (e.g., 4♥ or 4♠) clarify slam interest or additional suit holdings.
