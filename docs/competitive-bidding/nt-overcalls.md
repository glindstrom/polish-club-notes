# No Trump Overcalls

??? "1NT Overcall"

    ### Description
    A **1NT overcall** in second position shows 15-17 points with a stopper in the opponent’s suit.

    ### Development of the Auction
    The same methods apply after a 1NT overcall as after our 1NT opening, with the following exception:

    - A transfer to the opponent’s major suit (e.g., after a 1♥ opening, bidding 2♦) shows a three-suited hand short in the opponent’s suit and is forcing to game.

    #### Example Sequence

    | They | We  | They | We  |
    | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
    | 1♥   | 1NT | Pass | ?   |

    - **Responder’s Bid**: 2♣ - Stayman.
    - **Responder’s Bid**: 2♦ - Transfer to opponent’s suit; three-suiter, short in hearts, game forcing.
    - **Responder’s Bid**: 2♥ - Transfer to spades.

        | Response | Description                     |
        | -------- | ------------------------------- |
        | XX       | SOS, two playable suits, escape |
        | 2♣       | Natural, non-forcing            |
        | 2♦       | Natural, non-forcing            |
        | 2♥       | Natural, non-forcing            |

    ??? note "Rebids after 1NT Overcall - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)"
        ### Rebids after (1♠) - 1NT - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)

        | They | We  | They | We  |
        | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
        | 1♠   | 1NT | X    | XX  |
        | Pass | 2♣  | X    | ?   |

        | Responder’s Bid | Description             |
        | --------------- | ----------------------- |
        | Pass            | Confirms ♣ as one suit  |
        | 2♦              | Shows ♦ and ♥           |
        | XX              | Shows ♦ and ♥, longer ♥ |

        #### Note
        - A penalty double after a 1NT overcall (e.g., 1♠ - 1NT - X) prompts natural, non-forcing bids. Redouble (XX) is SOS, asking partner to bid a suit. After 2♣ (partner’s suit choice), responder clarifies suits: Pass confirms ♣ (e.g., ♣+♦ or ♣+♥), 2♦ shows ♦+♥ (as ♠ is the opponent’s suit), XX refines to ♦+♥ with longer ♥.

    #### Notes
    - In a competitive auction, similar rules apply as when an opponent intervenes after our 1NT opening.

??? "2NT Overcall"

    ### Description
    A **2NT overcall** after an opponent’s two-level opening shows 15-18 points and a stopper in the opponent’s suit.

    ### Development of the Auction
    After a **2NT overcall**, (Garbage) Stayman and Jacoby transfers are available to explore the best contract. Additionally:

    - **Responder’s Bid**: 3♠ - Game forcing with 5+4+ in the minor suits (clubs and diamonds).

??? "3NT Overcall"

    ### Description
    A **3NT overcall** is used in competitive bidding to show specific hand types, depending on whether it is a jump or non-jump overcall.

    - **Jump 3NT Overcall**: Shows a hand with a good (usually solid) minor suit and a stopper in the opponent’s suit.
    - **Non-Jump 3NT Overcall**: Can be based on either:
      - A minor suit, or
      - General strength of the hand (16-22 HCP).

    This applies in any position, including the reopening position, and after a **1♣ opening** followed by a **3NT rebid** by opener without partner’s support.

    ### Development of the Auction
    The responses to a 3NT overcall (or 3NT rebid after a 1♣ opening with interference) use **"transfers round the clock"** to explore the best contract. The same rules apply in all cases.

    ??? note "Example Sequences"
        1. **Direct 3NT Overcall**:

           | They | We  | They | We  |
           | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
           | 3♥   | 3NT | Pass | ?   |

        2. **After 4♣ (Transfer to Diamonds)**:

           | They | We          | They | We  |
           | ---- | ----------- | ---- | --- |
           | 3♥   | 3NT         | Pass | 4♣  |
           | Pass | 4♦ (forced) | Pass | ?   |

           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♥ - Heart shortage, slam interest.
           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♠ - Natural; diamonds and spades.

        3. **3NT Rebid After 1♣ Opening with Interference**:

           | They | We  | They | We   |
           | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
           |      | 1♣  | 3♥   | Pass |
           | Pass | 3NT | Pass | ?    |

           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♣ - Transfer to diamonds.
           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♦ - Transfer to hearts; three-suiter, short in hearts.
           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♥ - Transfer to spades.
           - **Responder’s Bid**: 4♠ - Transfer to clubs.

    #### Notes
    - The "transfers round the clock" system allows responder to explore fits in all suits efficiently.
    - The 4♦ response (transfer to hearts) specifically indicates a three-suiter with shortness in the opponent’s suit (e.g., hearts in a 3♥ overcall scenario).
    - After a 4♣ transfer to diamonds, responder’s further bids (e.g., 4♥ or 4♠) clarify slam interest or additional suit holdings.

??? "Re-opening NT"

    ### Description
    A **1NT overcall** in the balancing position shows 11-15 HCP and does not promise a stopper in the opponent’s suit, but it denies shortness in the opened suit (with shortness, we double). This allows us to compete when both partners have balanced hands (e.g., 12-13 HCP) unsuited for a takeout double (e.g., one partner has a doubleton in the other major, and the other has three cards in that suit but four in the opponent’s suit). This prevents opponents from winning the bidding with minimal strength, which could cost us a making game or partial, especially at matchpoints.

    A **2NT overcall** in the balancing position after an opponent’s one-level opening shows 19-21 HCP and a stopper in the opponent’s suit.

    With 16-18 HCP, we double and later bid NT at the cheapest possible level.

    A **2NT overcall** in the balancing position after an opponent’s two-level opening shows 14-17 HCP and a stopper in the opponent’s suit. (Garbage) Stayman and Jacoby transfers are available after this.

    ??? note "Example Sequences"
        1. **1NT in Balancing Position**:

           | They | We   | They | We  |
           | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
           | 1♦   | Pass | Pass | 1NT |

           - **1NT**: 11-15 HCP, no stopper in diamonds required, denies shortness in diamonds.

        2. **1NT after Double (16-18 HCP)**:

           | They | We   | They | We  |
           | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
           | 1♦   | Pass | Pass | X   |
           | Pass | 1♥   | Pass | 1NT |

           - **1NT**: 16-18 HCP with a diamond stopper.

        3. **2NT in Balancing Position (One-Level Opening)**:

           | They | We   | They | We  |
           | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
           | 1♦   | Pass | Pass | 2NT |

           - **2NT**: 19-21 HCP with a diamond stopper.

        4. **2NT in Balancing Position (Two-Level Opening)**:

           | They | We   | They | We  |
           | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
           | 2♦   | Pass | Pass | 2NT |

           - **2NT**: 14-17 HCP with a diamond stopper.(Garbage) Stayman and Jacoby transfers apply.

    ### Development of the Auction
    After a **1NT overcall** in the balancing position, the same methods apply as after a 1NT overcall in second position (see above), with appropriate adjustments for the 11-15 HCP range.

    After a **2NT overcall** in the balancing position (14-17 HCP or 19-21 HCP), (Garbage) Stayman and Jacoby transfers are available to explore the best contract, similar to a 2NT overcall in second position. Additionally:

    - **Responder’s Bid**: 3♠ - Game forcing with 5+4+ in the minor suits (clubs and diamonds).
