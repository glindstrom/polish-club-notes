# Two-Suited Overcalls

## Overview

Two-suited overcalls show a hand with typically 5-5 or better distribution, including at least one major or both minors, after opponents open at the one, two, or three level. Strength varies by vulnerability:
- Favorable: Minimal defensive tricks.
- Vulnerable: Opening strength (12+ points) or strong distribution.
- No upper strength limit.
