# Balancing

Summary of balancing actions:

1. A takeout double may be made with as few as 9 HCP, but only with shortness in the opponent’s suit. Partner should consider this possibility when responding.
2. A balancing 1NT shows 11–15 HCP and a balanced hand. Stayman and transfers apply.
3. A balancing 2NT shows 19–21 HCP and a balanced hand. Stayman and transfers apply.
4. With 16–18 HCP and a balanced hand, double first and then bid NT over partner’s response.
5. A jump-shift (even non-vulnerable) is constructive, showing a good 6-card suit and 11–15 HCP.
