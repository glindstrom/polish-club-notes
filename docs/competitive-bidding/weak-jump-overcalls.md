# Weak Jump Overcalls

## Overview
Weak jump overcalls are preemptive bids designed to disrupt opponents' bidding by taking up bidding space and forcing them to make decisions at higher levels. They typically show a long suit with limited high card points (HCP), aiming to obstruct while conveying specific hand characteristics.

## Definition
A weak jump overcall is a single jump bid over an opponent's opening bid, promising:
- **At the 2-level**: A 6-card suit, similar to a Weak Two opening bid.
- **At the 3-level**: A 7-card suit.
- **HCP Range**: 5-10 HCP, adjusted by vulnerability and partnership agreement.
- **Vulnerability Considerations**: Aggressive pairs may preempt with slightly shorter suits (e.g., a good 5-card suit) when not vulnerable. At unfavorable vulnerability, passing may be wiser with minimal HCP (e.g., 5 points).

## Responses to a Weak Jump Overcall
Responses are designed to either support the preemptive strategy or explore game potential, depending on partnership agreements.

| **Response**          | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Raise**      | Shows 3- or 4-card support, ~6-13 points. Preemptive, non-forcing.           |
| **Jump Raise**        | Weak and preemptive with at least 4-card support, or 5-card support of any strength. In a major suit, may also indicate a strong hand expecting game. |
| **New Suit**          | Natural, non-forcing. Typically shows a 6-card suit, denying support for partner's suit. |
| **2NT**               | Ogust convention: Artificial, forcing, showing 15+ HCP with interest in game, often with trump support. Overcaller responds per the Ogust convention (see below). |
| **Cuebid of Opponent’s Suit** | Forcing raise, showing interest in game. Overcaller rebids minimally with a weak hand or bids game/side suit feature with a stronger hand. |

## Ogust Convention
The **Ogust 2NT** response is a conventional, artificial bid used after a weak jump overcall (or weak two bid), showing 15+ HCP and interest in game, often with trump support. It is forcing for one round. The preemptor responds as follows:

| **Bid** | **Meaning**                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 3♣      | Bad hand (5-7 HCP), 1 of top 3 honors in suit.   |
| 3♦      | Bad hand (5-7 HCP), 2 of top 3 honors in suit.   |
| 3♥      | Good hand (8-10 HCP), 1 of top 3 honors in suit. |
| 3♠      | Good hand (8-10 HCP), 2 of top 3 honors in suit. |
| 3NT     | Good hand (8-10 HCP), all 3 top honors in suit.  |

**Mnemonic**: "Minors are Minimum, 1-2-1-2-3" (3♣/3♦ for minimum hands, 3♥/3♠ for good hands with 1-2 honors, 3NT for all 3 honors).

**Ogust Bidder’s Rebids**: Natural, based on the preemptor’s response and partnership goals.

## Notes
- Weak jump overcalls prioritize disruption over constructive bidding. Use them to pressure opponents, especially when they are likely to have a fit or game.
- Partnership agreements are critical for defining suit length, HCP ranges, and the use of Ogust as the 2NT response.
- Vulnerability significantly impacts aggression. Be cautious at unfavorable vulnerability with minimum hands.
