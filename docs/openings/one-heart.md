??? note "Response 1♠"
    ### Response 1♠

    - **Meaning**: 4+♠.
    
    ??? note "Choosing Between 1♠ and 2♥ with 4(5)♠ and 3♥"
        A common problem is whether to respond 1♠ or 2♥ holding 4(5) spades and 3 hearts.

        - **Guideline**: Respond 1♠ only when you can afford to rebid 3♥ on the next round.  
        - With weaker hands (7–9(10) HLDF) and 3-card support, prefer raising hearts directly to 2♥ rather than bidding 1♠.

        **Examples**  
        ```
        1♥   1♠  
        2♣   3♥
        ```
        Responder shows an invitational hand (10–12 HLDF) with at least 4 spades and 3 hearts.  

        ```
        1♥   1♠  
        2♣   2♥
        ```
        Responder makes a weak preference with a doubleton. With 3 hearts and 7–9 HCP, responder should not bid spades on the first round, but raise partner’s hearts.
