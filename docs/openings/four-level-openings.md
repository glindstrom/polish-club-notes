# Four-Level Openings

### Opening Description

- **Suit Distribution**:
  - Typically promises a seven-card suit.
  - Opening with a minor suit indicates a non-standard distribution (e.g., an eight-card suit or 7-4 distribution), as 3NT is bypassed.
- **Strength**:
  - At least one trick stronger than a three-level opening.
- **After Partner’s Pass**:
  - Openings can be quite random—both weaker and stronger than expected.
