    | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 3♣             | Strong; 5-4 pattern                                                          |

    | 3NT            | 6-9 points; 4-4 pattern¹                                                     |
    | 4♣/4♦          | Strong; 5-5 pattern, showing shortness (4NT agrees hearts, 5♣ agrees spades) |

    #### Responder’s Continuation after 2♣ - 2NT - 3♣ - 3♦
    - **Context**: 3♣ = strong 5-4 pattern, 3♦ = further inquiry

    | Opener’s Rebid | Description                                             |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 3♥             | Longer spades (3♠ agrees spades, cue bid agrees hearts) |
    | 3♠             | Longer hearts (4♣ agrees hearts, 4♦ agrees spades)      |

    #### Footnote
    - ¹ Only in the 6-9 point range do we open 2♣ with a 4-4 pattern non-vulnerable (below 6 points, 4-4 is not opened; vulnerable requires 5-4 minimum).

??? note "Response 3♣"
    ### Response 3♣

    - **Meaning**: Invitational to 4♥ with a four-card heart fit.
    - **Opener’s Response**:
      - Usually bids a transfer (3♦ or 4♦) to accept or decline the invitation.
      - May bid hearts directly if play is better from opener’s hand.

??? note "Response 3♦"
    ### Response 3♦

    - **Meaning**: Invitational to 4♠ with a four-card spade fit.
    - **Opener’s Response**:
      - Usually bids a transfer (3♥ or 4♥) to accept or decline the invitation.

??? note "Tactical Responses"
    ### Tactical Responses

    - **Recommended Approach**: Avoid artificial (asking) bids in favor of tactical bidding:
      - **2♥/2♠**: Shows better fit (e.g., for lead-directing purposes).
      - **3♥/3♠**: Shows four-card fit with a varied hand; partner cannot raise.
      - **4♥/4♠**: Tactical (to make or block); further passes are not forcing.
