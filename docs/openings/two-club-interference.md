    #### Sequence: 2♣ - (Double) - ?
    | Response | Meaning                |
    | -------- | ---------------------- |
    | Pass     | I can play in clubs    |
    | Redouble | Bid your longer suit   |
    | 2♦       | I have diamonds        |
    | Others   | Same as without double |

    #### Note
    - The same scheme applies after our 2♣ overcall of major suits in defense (e.g., after opponent's 1NT opening).
