# Three-Level Openings

### Opening Description

- **Suit Distribution**:
  - Typically promises a seven-card suit.
  - Non-vulnerable: Can open with a six-card suit in an interesting distribution (e.g., with a four-card side suit).
- **Strength**:
  - Non-vulnerable: No specific strength required.
  - Vulnerable: Guarantees at least a good suit.
- **After Partner’s Pass**:
  - Openings can be quite random—both weaker and stronger than expected. Partner should only bid with a very good fit.

    ### Further Bidding

    #### After Opening in a Minor Suit
    | Bid                  | Meaning                       |
    | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
    | 3 in a new suit      | Forces one round              |
    | 4 in the other minor | Strongly agrees opener's suit |
    | 4 in a major suit    | To play                       |

    #### After Opening in a Major Suit
    | Bid           | Meaning                         |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | 3♠ (after 3♥) | Natural and forcing             |
    | 4♥ (after 3♠) | To play                         |
    | 4♣/4♦         | Cue bids agreeing opener's suit |

    #### Note
    - With greater strength (6-9 HCP) and a seven-card major suit, non-vulnerable, we can start with 2♦ and bid our suit at the three level in the next round.

??? note "3NT Opening"
    ### 3NT Opening

    #### Description
    - Shows a solid seven-card minor suit without high honors in side suits.

    #### Response Structure
    | Response | Meaning              |
    | -------- | -------------------- |
    | 4♣/5♣    | Pass with clubs      |
    | 4♦       | Asking for shortness |
    | 4♥/4♠    | Natural              |

    #### Sequence: 3NT - 4♦ (Asking for Shortness)
    | Response | Meaning                            |
    | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
    | 4♥/4♠    | Showing shortness                  |
    | 4NT      | Shortness in the other minor       |
    | 5♣/5♦    | Showing own suit without shortness |

    #### Notes
    - After an opponent's double of 3NT, partner's pass accepts the contract and promises stoppers in side suits.
    - Opening 3NT after partner's pass (third or fourth seat) may deviate from the standard (opener may have stoppers in addition to the minor suit). Partner’s pass over an opponent's double does not promise stoppers—opener "defends themselves." Partner can redouble to show stoppers in side suits.
