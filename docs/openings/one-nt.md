    | 2♣       | Stayman, 0+ HCP, asks for major 4-card suits |
    | 2♦       | 0+ HCP, transfer to ♥, 5+♥ |
    | 2♥       | 0+ HCP, transfer to ♠, 5+♠ |
    | 2♠       | 0+ HCP, transfer to ♣, 6+♣ |
    | 2NT      | 8-9 HCP, invitational to 3NT |
    | 3♣       | 0+ HCP, transfer to ♦, 6+♦, weak or game forcing |
    | 3♦       | 7-9 HCP, invitational, 6♦ |
    | 3♥       | 9+ HCP, 5-4 minors, ♥ shortness, game forcing |
    | 3♠       | 9+ HCP, 5-4 minors, ♠ shortness, game forcing |
    | 4♦       | “Big” transfer to ♥ |
    | 4♥       | “Big” transfer to ♠ |

    #### Note

    - 2♣ Stayman can be used with 0+ HCP for competitive auctions or lead suggestion. 2♦/2♥/2♠/3♣ transfers show 5+/6+ cards in the target suit. 3♥/3♠ show 5-4 minors with shortness in the bid major.

    - After 2♦/2♥ transfers, super-accept (2NT, 3♥/3♠) requires a very good fit and maximum opener (15-17 HCP, 19+ HLDF). 2♠ transfer aims to play 3♣, check 5♣ vs. 3NT, or prepare slam. 3♣ transfer is weak or game forcing; 3♦ is invitational. 3♥/3♠ show 5-4 minors, shortness in bid major. 3♠ after `1NT-2♣-2♥` is a strong ♥ agreement, not Trybuła Transfer.
