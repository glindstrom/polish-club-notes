    #### Notes
    - **2♣ Stayman**: Can be used with 0+ HCP for competitive auctions or lead suggestion.
    - **Transfers (2♦/2♥/2♠/3♣)**: Show 5+/6+ cards in the target suit.
    - **3♥/3♠**: Indicate 5-4 minors with shortness in the bid major.
    - **Super-accepts (after 2♦/2♥)**: 2NT or 3♥/3♠ requires a very good fit and maximum opener (15-17 HCP, 19+ HLDF).
    - **2♠ Transfer**: Aims to play 3♣, check 5♣ vs. 3NT, or prepare slam.
    - **3♣ Transfer**: Weak or game forcing.
    - **3♦**: Invitational with 6♦.
    - **3♠ after 1NT-2♣-2♥**: Strong ♥ agreement, not Trybuła Transfer.
