    ### Responder Responses after 1♦ - (X)

    | Response | Description                                      |
    | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | XX       | 10+ HCP, denies diamond support                  |
    | 1♥       | 5-9 HCP, natural, non-forcing, good suit quality |
    | 1♠       | 5-9 HCP, natural, non-forcing, good suit quality |
    | 2♣       | 5-9 HCP, natural, non-forcing, good suit quality |
    | 2♦       | 5-9 HCP, weak raise, 3-card diamond support      |
    | 2♥       | 5-9 HCP, preemptive, 6+♥                         |
    | 2♠       | 5-9 HCP, preemptive, 6+♠                         |
    | 3♣       | 5-9 HCP, preemptive, 6+♣                         |

    #### Note

    - Redouble shows 10+ HCP and does not require diamond support. Unlike after a 1♣ opening, no major suit bid is forcing, as strong hands can redouble even with short diamonds.

    ### Responder Responses after 1♦ - (1♥)

    | Response | Description                                         |

    | 1♠       | 7+ HCP, transfer to 1NT, does not promise ♥ stopper |
    | 1NT      | 7-10 HCP, natural, implies ♥ stopper                |

    #### Note

    - 1♠ is a transfer to 1NT, enabling partner to play NT without a ♥ stopper. 1NT shows 7-10 HCP with a ♥ stopper. 2♥ shows diamond support (10+ HCP).
