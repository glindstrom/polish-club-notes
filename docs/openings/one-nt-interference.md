    ### Responses after 1NT - (X, Conventional)

    | Response | Description                                            |
    | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | XX       | 8+ HCP, aims to penalize opponents                     |
    | Pass     | Forcing after redouble                                 |
    | Other    | Same as without double (e.g., 2♣ Stayman, 2♦ transfer) |

    #### Note
    - Conventional double (e.g., 4-major, 5-minor) does not change most responses. Redouble (8+ HCP) seeks to penalize, with forcing passes after redouble.

    ### Rebids after 1NT Opening - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)

    | Responder’s Bid | Description                  |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Pass            | Confirms ♣ as one suit       |
    | 2♦              | Shows ♦ and a major (♥ or ♠) |
    | XX              | Shows ♦ and M, longer M      |

    #### Note
    - Penalty double after 1NT opening prompts natural, non-forcing bids. Redouble is SOS, asking partner to bid a suit. After 2♣ (opener’s suit choice), responder clarifies suits: Pass confirms ♣ (e.g., ♣+♦, ♣+♥, ♣+♠), 2♦ shows ♦+♥ or ♦+♠, XX refines to ♦+♥ with longer ♥.

    ### Rebids after 1NT - (2♠) - 3♦ (Transfer to ♥)

    | Opener’s Rebid | Description                         |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |

    #### Note
    - Rubensohl applies after natural 2-level overcalls. 2-level bids are non-forcing; 2NT-3♥ are transfers (6+ HCP, except 3♦ asks for stopper). Opener usually accepts transfers at the lowest level, bids game with exceptional hands.

    | X        | Negative, forcing |
    | Other    | Natural, forcing  |

    #### Note
    - After artificial 2♣ (both majors), double (8+ HCP) seeks to penalize. 2-level bids are non-forcing; 2NT-3♥ are transfers (at least invitational, 6+ HCP implied). 3-level bidding uses negative double and natural, forcing bids.
