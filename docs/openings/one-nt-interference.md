# 1NT Opening - Interference

### General Principles for Natural Overcalls

After an opponent’s natural overcall over our 1NT opening, we apply the following principles:

- Double is for takeout, 5+ points.
- A new suit at the two level is natural and non-forcing.
- Bids from 2NT to 3♥ are transfers with at least invitational strength; a transfer to the opponent’s suit asks for a stopper in that suit.
- 3♠ shows at least 5-4 in the minors and is game forcing.

    ### Responses after 1NT - (X, Conventional)

    | Response | Description                                            |
    | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | XX       | 8+ HCP, aims to penalize opponents                     |
    | Pass     | Forcing after redouble                                 |
    | Other    | Same as without double (e.g., 2♣ Stayman, 2♦ transfer) |

    #### Note
    - Conventional double (e.g., 4-major, 5-minor) does not change most responses. Redouble (8+ HCP) seeks to penalize, with forcing passes after redouble.

    ### Responses after 1NT Opening - (X, Penalty)

    | Response | Description                     |
    | -------- | ------------------------------- |
    | XX       | SOS, two playable suits, escape |
    | 2♣       | Natural, non-forcing            |
    | 2♦       | Natural, non-forcing            |
    | 2♥       | Natural, non-forcing            |

    ### Rebids after 1NT Opening - (X, Penalty) - XX - (Pass) - 2♣ - (X)

    | Responder’s Bid | Description                  |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Pass            | Confirms ♣ as one suit       |
    | 2♦              | Shows ♦ and a major (♥ or ♠) |
    | XX              | Shows ♦ and M, longer M      |

    #### Note
    - Penalty double after 1NT opening prompts natural, non-forcing bids. Redouble is SOS, asking partner to bid a suit. After 2♣ (opener’s suit choice), responder clarifies suits: Pass confirms ♣ (e.g., ♣+♦, ♣+♥, ♣+♠), 2♦ shows ♦+♥ or ♦+♠, XX refines to ♦+♥ with longer ♥.
