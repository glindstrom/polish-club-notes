    #### Notes
    - After an overcall at the two level, we use support double.
    - 2♦ can be [Odwrotka](../conventions/odwrotka.md) in relevant sequences.
    - After an overcall of 2♦ or higher, double often promises a Strong Club (18+;).
    - Opponent’s suit without a jump denies a fit.
    - Opponent’s suit with a jump is a splinter, showing shortness in the bid suit and support for partner’s suit.
