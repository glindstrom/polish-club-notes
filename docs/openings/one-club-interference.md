    #### Notes
    - After an overcall at two of the trump suit or higher, a double indicates a strong club (18+), and the fit-showing double convention does not apply.
    - 2♦ can be [Odwrotka](../conventions/odwrotka.md) in relevant sequences.
    - Opponent’s suit without a jump denies a fit.
    - Opponent’s suit with a jump is a splinter, showing shortness in the bid suit and support for partner’s suit.

??? note "Bidding Clubs in Competitive Auctions"
    ### Bidding Clubs in Competitive Auctions

    Bidding clubs at the two level is not forcing, e.g., after 1♣ - (pass) - 1♥ - (1♠):  
    - 2♣: 12-17  
    - 3♣: 18+  

    A free 3♣ bid after a positive response to 1♣ is forcing.  

    With a weak hand and clubs, bid 2NT to play at the lowest level, e.g.:  
    - After 1♣ - (1♥) - 1NT - (2♥), or 1♣ - (1♥) - double - (2♥):  
      - 2NT: clubs, "I want to play at the lowest level"  
      - 3♣: clubs, forcing  

    However, after a negative double at the two level, e.g., 1♣ - (2♦/2♥/2♠) - double - (pass):  
    - 2NT: natural  
    - 3♣: non-forcing
