    #### Notes
    - ¹ With 5-3-3-2 including clubs, bid better major; with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, bid 3-card major if available, otherwise 2♣.
    - With a two-suited hand (at least 5-5) that’s game forcing, opener bids with a double jump (3♥, 3♠, 4♣).
    - With a minor five-card suit and a major four-card suit, opener bids the major unless they have game forcing strength.
    - With a weak balanced variant (12-14), opener bids 1♥ or 1♠, showing their longer major (can be three cards in extreme cases).
    - Game forcing hands: 24+ balanced, 23+ with five-card major, 22+ with two-suited hand (at least 5-4).

    #### Further Bidding after 1♣ - 1♦ - 1♥
    - **Context**: Responder (E) has 0-6 points or 7-11 in minors; opener (W) has hearts no worse than clubs, strength unspecified.
    - Responder continues with strength above 4 points:

    #### Notes
