        #### Notes
        - Two-suiters are only shown after a 1♦ response. They are never used after any intervention by the opponents.
        - Two-suiters not strong enough for a game force after a 1♦ response are shown by bidding the major suit at the one level followed by a jump to the three level in the other suit on the next round of bidding.
        - ¹ With 5-3-3-2 including clubs, bid better major; with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, bid 3-card major if available, otherwise 2♣.
        - With a two-suited hand (at least 5-5) that’s game forcing, opener bids with a double jump (3♥, 3♠, 4♣).
        - With a minor five-card suit and a major four-card suit, opener bids the major unless they have game forcing strength.
        - With a weak balanced variant (12-14), opener bids 1♥ or 1♠, showing their longer major (can be three cards in extreme cases).
        - Game forcing hands: 24+ balanced, 23+ with five-card major, 22+ with two-suited hand (at least 5-4).

        #### Notes
        - Stayman and major suit transfers limit responder to 6 points; next bid is non-forcing (e.g., 1♣ - 1♦ - 1NT - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♠: 4-6 points, non-forcing).
        - 5-4-3-1 convention and minor suit transfers limit responder to 11 points; 5-4-3-1 is forcing to game.
        - Smolen applies only after 3♣ Stayman → 3♦ (no 4-card major).


    ??? note "2♦ Rebid (Game Forcing, Not Two-Suited)"
        #### 2♦ Rebid (Game Forcing, Not Two-Suited)
        - **Meaning**: Opener’s 2♦ rebid after `1♣ - 1♦` is game-forcing and does not promise a two-suited hand.

        | Responder’s Bid | Meaning                               |

        ??? note "Further Bidding after 1♣ - 1♦ - 2♦ - 2♥"
            #### Further Bidding after 1♣ - 1♦ - 2♦ - 2♥
            - **Meaning**: Responder’s 2♥ is a second negative, indicating a weak hand with no significant features.
            - **Opener’s Rebids**:
            - **2NT**: Shows a balanced hand with at least 24 HCP, game-forcing (even if responder has zero points, the auction cannot stop short of game). The auction proceeds as it would after `1♣ - 1♦ - 2NT` (see [Notrump Rebids](#notrump-rebids-1nt-18-20-2nt-21-23) for responder’s bids).
            - **2♠, 3♣, 3♦, 3♥**: Natural, showing a 5+ card suit in the bid suit.

            #### Notes
            - The 2♥ response allows opener to describe their hand further, with 2NT indicating a strong balanced hand and other bids showing specific suits naturally.
            - Opener’s 2NT rebid with 24+ HCP uses the same response structure as the 2NT rebid after `1♣ - 1♦` (21-23 HCP), including Stayman, transfers, and other conventions as outlined in the Notrump Rebids section.

        ??? note "Further Bidding after 1♣ - 1♦ - 2♦ - 2NT"
            #### Further Bidding after 1♣ - 1♦ - 2♦ - 2NT
            - **Meaning**: Responder’s 2NT shows 5-6 points and a balanced hand.
            - **Opener’s Rebids**: Opener bids naturally, showing specific suits or features:
            - 3♣: Shows a club suit (typically 5+ cards).
            - Other bids (e.g., 3♦, 3♥, 3♠): Natural, showing a 5+ card suit in the bid suit.
            - 3NT: Suggests a balanced hand suitable for notrump, typically with stoppers in unbid suits.

            #### Notes
            - Opener’s natural bids aim to describe their hand further, allowing responder to clarify their holding or suggest a final contract.
            - The auction remains game-forcing due to the 2♦ rebid.

    ??? note "Other Rebids"
        #### Other Rebids
        - 2♥/2♠: 21-22 points with a 5-card suit (non-forcing, but partner should continue if possible).
        - 3♣/3♦: 18+ with a 6-card suit.

??? note "Response 1♥"
    ### Response 1♥

    - **Meaning**: 7+ points, 4+ hearts.
    - **Note**: With 6 points and a one-suited hand, prefer 1♦ to define strength; with a two-suited hand (e.g., 5-5), prefer 1♥ to show both suits.

??? note "Responses 2♣/2♦"
    ### Responses 2♣/2♦

    - **Meaning**: 12+ points, 5+ cards in the bid suit (2♣ shows 5+♣, 2♦ shows 5+♦), game forcing. Note that the rebid structure is taken from WJ2020 as the structure in WJ2025 isn't playable since e.g. the strong hands with 5+ diamonds have no rebid as the 2♦ rebid is designated to weak hands.

        Later in the auction, opener’s rebid of their own suit promises five cards and a Strong Club. Bidding after the 2♦ response is analogous, with adjustments for the suits involved.

    ### Responses 3♣/3♦

    - **Meaning**: 9-11 points, good 6+ card suit, invitational.
    - **Note**: With a weak suit, bid 1♦ first, then jump in the minor.
    - After a 3♣ or 3♦ response, opener with the weak club variant (12-14 HCP) can pass or bid 3NT. Other opener’s bids show a strong club (18+ HCP) and typically a 5-card suit.

    #### Notes
    - Opener’s return to responder’s suit means their rebid was intended to check for stoppers for 3NT.
    - Responder can raise opener’s suit even with second-round support, or show a cue bid in a side suit with an excellent fit.
