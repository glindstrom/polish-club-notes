    | 3♥       | Strong; five clubs                      |
    | 3♠       | Strong; five diamonds                   |

    #### After 2♥ - 2NT - 3♣
    - **Note**: Responder may pass after 3♣ or 3♦; otherwise, bidding is forced to game.

??? note "Further Bidding Tactics"
    ### Further Bidding Tactics

    - **Recommended Approach**:
      - Avoid asking bids in favor of tactical bidding:
        - Raise partner's suit to three with a three-card fit.
        - Raise partner's suit to four with a four-card fit; passes after this bid are not forcing.
      - Asking about the second suit can help opponents with defense (especially the opening lead).
