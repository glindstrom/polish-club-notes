    #### Notes
    - After responses at the three level, bidding a minor suit agrees that suit and forces.
    - After responses at the four level, 4NT asks for 4 aces (since the trump suit is unknown).
    - The 3♠ response requires partner to bid 3NT.
    - The same principles apply after our 2NT overcall of minor suits.
