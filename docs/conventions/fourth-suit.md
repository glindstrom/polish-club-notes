# Fourth Suit Forcing

### Description

- **Context**: In uncontested bidding, responder bids the fourth suit after the partnership has shown three suits, with no trump suit agreed.
- **Meaning**: Artificial and forcing, used to explore the best contract (suit or NT), verify stoppers for NT, or investigate slam.
- **Note**: The fourth suit bid may later be shown as a natural suit (e.g., 1♦ – 1♠ – 2♣ – 2♥ – 2NT – 3♥ shows 5-5 in majors, non-forcing).
