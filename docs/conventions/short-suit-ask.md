# Shortness Ask

### Description

After opener’s 3♥ or 3♠ rebid (12-17 HCP, unbalanced, 4 cards in the bid major, 5+ in opened suit), responder’s 3♠ (after 3♥) or 3NT (after 3♠) asks for shortness to evaluate slam potential. Opener’s 3NT (after 3♠ ask) shows spade shortness, while 4 in the agreed major (4♥ or 4♠) shows no shortness. Other bids (4♣, 4♦, 4♥) are cue bids indicating shortness in the bid suit.
