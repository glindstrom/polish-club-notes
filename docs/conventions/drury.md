# Drury Convention

## Description

- **Context**: Used after a 1♥ or 1♠ overcall by partner. Responder bids 2♣ to show a fit (3+ cards in partner’s major) and 10+ points.
- **Applies**: After an opponent’s natural or artificial opening bid, when only one opponent has bid. Also applies when bidding fourth in hand (after one opponent has bid and the other has passed).
- **Does Not Apply**: If both opponents have bid or if responder has passed initially. In these cases, a cuebid shows support instead.

??? note "Passed Hand Drury"
    ### Passed Hand Drury

    - **Context**: Responder has passed initially, opponent opens, and partner overcalls 1♥ or 1♠.
    - **Bidding**:
      - 2♣ is natural, showing a club suit and denying a fit for partner’s major.
      - A cuebid of the opponent’s suit shows a maximum passed hand with a 3+ card fit for partner’s major.

    | Responder | Opponent | Partner | Opponent |
    |-----------|----------|---------|----------|
    | Pass      | 1♣/1♦    | 1♥/1♠   | Pass     |
    | ?         |          |         |          |

    | Responder’s Bid   | Meaning                                      |
    |-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | 2♣                | Natural, club suit, no fit for partner’s major |
    | Opponent’s suit   | Maximum passed hand, 3+ card fit for partner’s major |

## Additional Notes
- **Drury Does Not Apply**: When both opponents have bid. In this case, a cuebid shows support and is invitational or better. The cheaper cuebid shows 3-card support, and the more expensive cuebid shows 4-card support. However, if the opening bid is 1♣, 2♣ is natural (not a cuebid). For example:
  - Sequence: (1♣) – 1♥ – (1♠) – ?  
    - 2♣ is natural.
    - 2♠ shows support for hearts.
- **Examples of Drury Application**:
    - Applies: (1♥) – Pass – (Pass) – 1♠ – (Pass).
    - Does Not Apply: Pass – (1♥) – 1♠ – (Pass), as responder has passed initially.
