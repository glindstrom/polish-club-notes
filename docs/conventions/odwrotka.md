# Odwrotka Convention

### Description

- **Context**: Used by opener after a 1♣ opening and a 1♥ or 1♠ response, in both uncontested and contested bidding.
- **Meaning**: Artificial, promises a strong club variant (18+) with at least three-card support in partner’s suit¹.
- **Note**: Does not agree partner’s suit; further bidding may find a better trump suit.

    ### Bidding Details

    #### Notes
    - ¹ With an unbalanced hand (five clubs, three cards in partner’s suit), use Odwrotka even with 17 HCP.
    - **Avoid Using Odwrotka**:
      - With a second five-card major (complicates agreeing the second major).
      - With 5-4-3-1 shape (five-card minor, four cards in the other major, three in partner’s suit)—bid naturally.

    #### Responses to Odwrotka (1♣ - 1♥/1♠ - 2♦)
    - **Weak Hand**: Within 7+ points, not encouraging for slam.
    - **Strong Hand**: Would open at the one level, or 9-11 with a high-quality major and honors in long suits.
