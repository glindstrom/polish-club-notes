# Forcing 2NT

### Description

- **Context**: Responder bids 2NT after opener’s 2-level rebid or major-suit raise.
- **Meaning**: Forcing, used to find the best game strain (suit or 3NT) or explore slam, typically with a stopper in unbid suits unless a suit contract is certain.
- **Exceptions**: Non-forcing when a notrump raise (e.g., 1♥ – 1♠ – 1NT – 2NT) or after 1♥ – 1♠ – 1♠ – 2NT, where it invites 3NT.
