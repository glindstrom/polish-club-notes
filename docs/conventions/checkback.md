# Checkback

### Description

After opener’s 1♠ (12+ HCP, 4+♠) rebid following a 1♥ response to a 1♣ opening, or 1♠ (12-17 HCP, 4♠) or 1NT (12-14 HCP, balanced) rebid following a 1♥ response to a 1♦ opening, responder’s 2♣ (weak checkback, 10-12 HCP) or 2♦ (strong checkback, 13+ HCP) explores fit, strength, or the best contract. Weak checkback (2♣) prompts opener to bid 2♦ (mandatory unless strong), while strong checkback (2♦) is game-forcing and asks opener to describe their hand further.

### Sequences Where Checkback Applies
- **1♣ - 1♥ - 1♠/1NT - 2♣/2♦** [see details](../openings/one-club.md#responder-rebids-1c-1h-1s)
- **1♦ - 1♥ - 1♠ - 2♣/2♦** [see details](../openings/one-diamond.md#responder-rebids-1d-1h-1s)
- **1♦ - 1♥ - 1NT - 2♣/2♦** [see details](../openings/one-diamond.md#responder-rebids-1d-1h-1nt)

### Notes
- Weak checkback (2♣) is invitational, aiming to find a fit or stop in a partscore, and may include a 5-3-3-2 hand with 13-15 HCP.
- Strong checkback (2♦) is game-forcing, exploring game or slam potential with unspecified distribution.
- Checkbacks are also used if the first defender intervenes with a double.
- If an opponent makes a suit overcall, checkbacks do not apply. The opponent’s suit becomes the forcing bid, 2♣ and 2♦ are natural and non-forcing, and jumps are natural and invitational.
