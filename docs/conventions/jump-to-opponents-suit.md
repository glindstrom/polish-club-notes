# Jump to Opponent’s Suit at the Three Level

### Description

- **Context**: After opponent’s opening at the one level.
- **Meaning**: Bidding the opponent’s suit with a jump (e.g., (1♥) – 3♥) shows a solid minor suit or a very strong one-suited hand ("game forcing") and asks for a stopper in the opponent’s suit.
