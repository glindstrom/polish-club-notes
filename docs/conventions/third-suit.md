# Third Suit Convention

### Description

- **Context**: In uncontested bidding, responder bids a new suit after a two-over-one response, when partners have shown two suits, and no trump suit is agreed.
- **Meaning**: Either natural (4-card suit, seeking a trump suit) or seminatural (stopper in the bid suit, no stopper in the unbid suit, often to verify NT or explore slam).
- **Applies**: After a natural two-over-one or after a 1♣ opening (not showing a suit).

    | 1♥ – 2♣ – 2♥ – 2♠ – 3♠ – 3NT | Shows 2♠ was seminatural (not 4 spades), no diamond stopper |

    - **Note**: If opener also lacks a diamond stopper, they should correct the contract (e.g., to 4♠).

    - **General Rules for Opener**:
    - Third suit is forcing.
    - If bid at the 2-level: Raise to the 3-level with 4-card support (e.g., 1♥ – 2♣ – 2♥ – 2♠ – 3♠, never 4♠).
    - If bid at the 3-level: Raise to the 4-level with 4-card support and no stopper in the unbid suit.
    - Jump to 3NT: Shows 4-card support for the third suit and a stopper in the unbid suit.
    - Other bids:
      - Rebid own suit if long and strong.
      - Raise responder’s first suit with 3-card support.
      - Bid NT with a good stopper in the unbid suit (e.g., 1♥ – 2♣ – 2♥ – 3♠ – 3NT shows a diamond stopper).
