# Bidding After Major Suit Agreement

This section covers bidding situations where we have agreed on a major suit and an opponent intervenes.

??? note "Meaning of Double"
    ### Meaning of Double

    Double of the opponent's suit is optional from both hands and typically shows 4 cards in the doubled suit.

    #### Example 1: After Opponent’s Spade or Club Bid
    | We  | They | We  | They    |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ------- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 2♥  | 2♠ / 3♣ |

    | Bid    | Meaning                               |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
    | Double | Optional; 4 cards in the doubled suit |
    | 3♦     | Invitation to 4♥                      |
    | 3♥     | To play (non-invitational)            |

    #### Example 2: After Opponent’s Diamond Bid
    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | Pass | 2♥  | 3♦   |

    | Bid    | Meaning                                                   |
    | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Double | Optional; 4 cards in the doubled suit                     |
    | 3♦     | Extra values (points or distribution); no space to invite |

    ### When Opponents Have Agreed a Suit

    When the opponents have agreed on a suit, our double becomes an invitation to game.

    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | 2♦   | 2♥  | 3♦   |

    | Bid    | Meaning                   |
    | ------ | ------------------------- |
    | Double | Invitation to 4♥          |
    | 3♥     | To play; non-invitational |

??? note "After Opponent’s Early Intervention"
    ### After Opponent’s Early Intervention

    #### Strong Hand with No Exceptional Distribution
    | We  | They | We  | They |
    | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥  | 1♠   | 2♥  | 2♠   |

    | Bid    | Meaning                                       |
    | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
    | Double | Strong in points, no exceptional distribution |
    | 3♣/3♦  | Help suit game try                            |

    #### After Deciding to Play at the Two Level
    If we have already decided to play at the two level but an opponent continues bidding, our bids are no longer invitational. From the weaker hand, this becomes a proposal of a contract (6-card suit); from the stronger hand, it suggests an opening lead.

    | We   | They | We  | They |
    | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- |
    | 1♥   | 1♠   | 2♥  | Pass |
    | Pass | 2♠   |     |      |

    | Bid    | Meaning                                          |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | Double | Optional                                         |
    | 3♣/3♦  | Proposal of contract (shows 6 cards in the suit) |
