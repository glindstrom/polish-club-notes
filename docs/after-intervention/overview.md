# Bidding After Opponent Intervention Overview

### Description

Bidding after opponent intervention involves strategies to respond to opponents’ overcalls, doubles, or other bids following our opening. Agreements include two-suited bids, natural responses, and general principles to compete effectively, tailored for specific interference scenarios and undiscussed situations.

### General Principles

When our opening bid is followed by opponent intervention, we use the following rules:

- Most bids by responder are natural.
- Transfers are used in these sequences:
    - At the one level after 1♦ or 1♥ overcalls.
    - After our 1♥ or 1♠ openings are doubled.
- A new suit at the two level is forcing for one round.
- A new suit with a jump shows a long suit (6+) with less than invitational strength.

**Doubles & Stoppers**

- **Principle.** Responder’s double is **for takeout** whenever the previous bidding has **not limited responder’s strength** (e.g., responder has not already shown a narrow range such as a 1NT response, a simple raise limiting values, or a weak jump). Default aim: find a fit rather than penalize.
- **Principle.** When a double is for takeout, its main objective is to **search for a major-suit fit**. By contrast, **bidding the opponents’ suit (cue-bid)** asks for a **stopper for notrump** or **prepares for slam exploration**.
- **Principle.** When the opponents have bid **two suits**, we **bid the suit we stop**
