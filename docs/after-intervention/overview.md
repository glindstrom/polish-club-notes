# Bidding After Opponent Intervention Overview

### Description

Bidding after opponent intervention involves strategies to respond to opponents’ overcalls, doubles, or other bids following our opening. Agreements include two-suited bids, natural responses, and general principles to compete effectively, tailored for specific interference scenarios and undiscussed situations.

### General Principles

When our opening bid is followed by opponent intervention, we use the following rules:
- Most bids by responder are natural.
- Transfers are used in these sequences:
  - At the one level after 1♦ or 1♥ overcalls.
  - After our 1♥ or 1♠ openings are doubled.
- A new suit at the two level is forcing for one round.
- A new suit with a jump shows a long suit (6+) with less than invitational strength.
