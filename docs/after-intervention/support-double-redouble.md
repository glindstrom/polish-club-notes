    ### Support Double (X) and Redouble (XX)

    Support double and redouble are used up to the 2-level to show support for partner’s suit after an opponent’s intervention.

    - **Support Double (X)**: Shows 3-card support for responder’s suit. Not mandatory; opener can pass with a hand unsuitable for encouraging further bidding.
    - **Support Redouble (XX)**: Shows 3-card support for responder’s suit after opponent’s double. Not used after a 1♣ opening.

    #### Note

    - Applies only when the opponent’s bid is at the 2-level or lower (e.g., 1♥ - (2♣) or 1♠ - (1NT) - 2♥ - (X)).
