# Bidding After an Opponent’s Two-Suited Overcall

### Description

After an opponent’s two-suited overcall (e.g., Michaels cue bid or 2NT showing specific suits) following our 1♣, 1♦, 1♥, or 1♠ opening, responder’s bids show penalty interest, invitational or game-forcing strength, or non-invitational fits. These agreements guide the partnership to penalize opponents, explore game, or find the best contract.

#### Remark
The principles outlined below also apply when opponents make a two-suited overcall after our 1♣ opening, with responder’s bids adapted to the 1♣ context.

### Note on Cuebids After 1M Opening and 2NT Overcall
After a 1♥ or 1♠ opening and a 2NT overcall (showing both minors), responder’s 3♣ and 3♦ cuebids follow the memory rule: *lower corresponds to lower, higher to higher*. Thus:

- After 1♥ opening: 3♣ shows at least invitational strength with a heart fit, and 3♦ shows at least invitational strength with a spade suit.
- After 1♠ opening: 3♣ shows at least invitational strength with a heart suit, and 3♦ shows at least invitational strength with a spade fit.
